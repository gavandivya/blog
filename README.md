The Blog Application has two main sections in  it.
1)The Blog will be created and there will be different types of post which will be of different categories.
So here it is basically about creating the basic blog models, views, templates, and URLs to display blog post.
Configuring the Django administration, handling the forms and model forms and integrating third-party application.
2)A Comment System which will allow user to comment on the post which they like.The comment will include the name of the user,email
and the time at which the user commented on post and will even has the option of sharing the post via email to any recipient they want.
